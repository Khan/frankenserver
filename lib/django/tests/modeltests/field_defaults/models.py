32. Callable defaults

You can pass callable objects as the ``default`` parameter to a field. When
the object is created without an explicit value passed in, Django will call
the method to determine the default value.

This example uses ``datetime.datetime.now`` as the default for the ``pub_date``
field.

        return self.headline
