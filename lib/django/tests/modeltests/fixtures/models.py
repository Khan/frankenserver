37. Fixtures.

Fixtures are a way of loading data into the database in bulk. Fixure data 
can be stored in any serializable format (including JSON and XML). Fixtures 
are identified by name, and are stored in either a directory named 'fixtures'
in the application directory, on in one of the directories named in the 
FIXTURE_DIRS setting.
