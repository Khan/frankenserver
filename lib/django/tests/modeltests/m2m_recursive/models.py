28. Many-to-many relationships between the same two tables

In this example, A Person can have many friends, who are also people. Friendship is a
symmetrical relationship - if I am your friend, you are my friend.

A person can also have many idols - but while I may idolize you, you may not think
the same of me. 'Idols' is an example of a non-symmetrical m2m field. Only recursive
m2m fields may be non-symmetrical, and they are symmetrical by default.

This test validates that the m2m table will create a mangled name for the m2m table if
there will be a clash, and tests that symmetry is preserved where appropriate.
