# All filenames are taken to be relative to the directory containing
# this file.
#
# NOTE: These entries are normal glob patterns, with the addition that
# a leading '**/' means 'any number of directories here' (including 0
# so **/foo matches 'foo', 'a/foo', 'a/b/foo', etc.)  Directories
# should end in '/'.
