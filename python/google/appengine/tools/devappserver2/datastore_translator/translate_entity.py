"""Translation of entities between REST and App Engine APIs.

The App Engine concept here is datastore.Entity, which is much lower-level than
db/ndb models.  It stores property-values as a dict (the class actually
inherits from dict) as well as a list of those property values that are not
indexed (`entity.unindexed_properties()`) and the entity's key
(`entity.key()`).  Given a db.Model, one can grab the datastore.Entity as
`model_instance._entity`.  (There is no easy way to do so for an ndb.Model.)

The corresponding datastore concept is Entity, described at
    https://cloud.google.com/datastore/docs/reference/data/rest/v1/Entity
