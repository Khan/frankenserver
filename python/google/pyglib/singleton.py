"""Thread-safe implementation of a singleton decorator.

Sometimes, only a single instance of a class should ever be created. This file
provides a wrapper that turns a class into a Singleton. The constructor may
only be called once; a static method Singleton() provides access to the
constructed instance. If Singleton() is called before the constructor, or if
the constructor is called multiple times, Errors are raised. This wrapper is
thread-safe; calls to the constructor and Singleton() method are protected
by per-class locks.

Singletons are often associated with bad coding practices; see
http://wiki/Main/SingletonsConsideredDangerous and decide if you should
really be using this functionality. Consider alternatives, like the
"Borg pattern" where object state (instead of object identity) is shared.

To make your singletons more testable, use the following idiom:


class A(...):
  "All the complicated code goes in here, can be tested normally..."
  ..
  ..


@singleton.Singleton
class B(A):
  "Singleton instance of A"


Example usage:

from google.pyglib import singleton


@singleton.Singleton
class Foo(object):
  "Example singleton"


a = Foo()
b = Foo.Singleton()
c = Foo.Singleton()
assert a == b
assert b == c
"""

_CLASS_LOCKS = {}  # Holds the per-class locks.
_CLASS_LOCKS_LOCK = threading.Lock()  # Lock for obtaining a per-class lock.
_INSTANCES = {}  # Mapping from class to instantiated object.

    of the class it is decorating.
