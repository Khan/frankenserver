Reporting Bugs in PyAMF
***********************

Bug reports should be submitted via the PyAMF Bug Tracker on http://dev.pyamf.org.
The bug tracker offers a Web form which allows pertinent information to be entered
and submitted to the developers.

The first step in filing a report is to determine whether the problem has
already been reported.  The advantage in doing so, aside from saving the
developers time, is that you learn what has been done to fix it; it may be that
the problem has already been fixed for the next release, or additional
information is needed (in which case you are welcome to provide it if you can!).
To do this, search the bug database using the search box on the top of the page.

If the problem you're reporting is not already in the bug tracker, go back to
the PyAMF Bug Tracker.  If you don't already have a tracker account, select the
Register_ link in the navigation bar and undergo the registration procedure.
Otherwise, if you're not logged in, enter your credentials and select Login_.
It is not possible to submit a bug report anonymously.

Being now logged in, you can submit a bug.  Select the `New Ticket`_ link in the
sidebar to open the bug reporting form.

The submission form has a number of fields.  For the "Summary" field, enter a
*very* short description of the problem; less than ten words is good.  In the
"Type" field, select the type of your problem; also select the "Component" and
"Version" to which the bug relates.

In the "Description" field, describe the problem in detail, including what you
expected to happen and what did happen.  Be sure to include whether any
external modules were involved, and what hardware and software platform you
were using (including version information as appropriate).

Each bug report will be assigned to a developer who will determine what needs to
be done to correct the problem.  You will receive an update each time action is
taken on the bug.
