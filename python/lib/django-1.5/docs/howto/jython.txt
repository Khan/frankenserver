========================
Running Django on Jython
========================

.. index:: Jython, Java, JVM

As of January 2014, the latest release of `django-jython`_ supports Django 1.3
which is no longer supported (receiving fixes or security updates) by the
Django Project. We therefore recommend that you do not try to run Django on
Jython at this time.

The django-jython project is `seeking contributors`_ to help update its code for
newer versions of Django. You can select an older version of this documentation
to see the instructions we had for using Django with Jython. If django-jython
is updated and please `file a ticket`_ and we'll be happy to update our
documentation accordingly.
