Django 1.5.3 release notes
==========================

*September 14, 2013*

This is Django 1.5.4, the fourth release in the Django 1.5 series. It addresses
one security issue.

Denial-of-service via password hashers
--------------------------------------

In previous versions of Django no limit was imposed on the plaintext
length of a password. This allows a denial-of-service attack through
submission of bogus but extremely large passwords, tying up server
resources performing the (expensive, and increasingly expensive with
the length of the password) calculation of the corresponding hash.

As of 1.5.3, Django's authentication framework imposes a 4096-byte
limit on passwords, and will fail authentication with any submitted
password of greater length.
