6. Specifying ordering

Specify default ordering for a model using the ``ordering`` attribute, which
should be a list or tuple of field names. This tells Django how to order the
results of ``get_list()`` and other similar functions.

If a field name in ``ordering`` starts with a hyphen, that field will be
ordered in descending order. Otherwise, it'll be ordered in ascending order.
The special-case field name ``"?"`` specifies random order.

The ordering attribute is not required. If you leave it off, ordering will be
undefined -- not random, just undefined.
