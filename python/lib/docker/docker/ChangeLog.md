ChangeLog
=========

0.5.3
-----

* Fixed attaching when connecting to the daemon over a UNIX socket.

0.5.2
-----

* Fixed a bug where sockets were closed immediately when attaching over
  TLS.

0.5.1
-----

* Added a `assert_hostname` option to `TLSConfig` which can be used to
  disable verification of hostnames.
* Fixed SSL not working due to an incorrect version comparison
* Fixed streams not working on Windows

0.5.0
-----

* **This version introduces breaking changes!**
* Added `insecure_registry` parameter in `Client.push` and `Client.pull`.
  *It defaults to False and code pushing to non-HTTPS private registries
  might break as a result.*
* Added support for adding and dropping capabilities
* Added support for restart policy
* Added support for string values in `Client.create_container`'s `mem_limit`
* Added support for `.dockerignore` file in `Client.build`

### Bugfixes

* Fixed timeout behavior in `Client.stop`

### Miscellaneous

* `Client.create_container` provides better validation of the `volumes`
  parameter
* Improved integration tests

0.4.0
-----

* **This version introduces breaking changes!**
* The `base_url` parameter in the `Client` constructor should now allow most
  of the `DOCKER_HOST` environment values (except for the fd:// protocol)
    * As a result, URLs that don't specify a port are now invalid (similar
    to the official client's behavior)
* Added TLS support (see [documentation](https://github.com/dotcloud/docker-py#connection-to-daemon-using-https))

### Bugfixes

* Fixed an issue with `Client.build` streamed logs in Python 3

### Miscellaneous

* Added unit tests coverage
* Various integration tests fixes

0.3.2
-----

* Default API version is now 1.12 (support for docker 1.0)
* Added new methods `Client.get_image` and `Client.load_image`
  (`docker save` and `docker load`)
* Added new method `Client.ping`
* Added new method `Client.resize`
* `Client.build` can now be provided with a custom context using the
  `custom_context` parameter.
* Added support for `memswap_limit` parameter in `create_container`
* Added support for `force` parameter in `remove_container`
* Added support for `force` and `noprune` parameters in `remove_image`

* Added support for `dns_search` parameter in `start`
* Added support for `network_mode` parameter in `start`
* Added support for `size` parameter in `containers`
* Added support for `volumes_from` and `dns` parameters in `start`. As of
  API version >= 1.10, these parameters no longer belong to `create_container`
* `Client.logs` now uses the logs endpoint when API version is sufficient

### Bugfixes

* Fixed a bug in pull where the `repo:tag` notation wasn't interpreted
  properly
* Fixed a bug in streaming methods with python 3 (unicode, bytes/str related)
* Fixed a bug in `Client.start` where legacy notation for volumes wasn't
  supported anymore.

### Miscellaneous

* The client now raises `DockerException`s when appropriate. You can import
  `DockerException` (and its subclasses) from the `docker.errors` module to
  catch them if needed.
* `docker.APIError` has been moved to the new `docker.errors` module as well.
* `Client.insert` is deprecated in API version > 1.11
* Improved integration tests should now run much faster.
* There is now a single source of truth for the docker-py version number.

  minus the historical data.
