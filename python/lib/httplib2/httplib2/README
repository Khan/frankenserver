The httplib2 code in this directory was integrated from the httplib2 code in
//third_party/py/httplib2.

Local modifications from the original //third_party/py/httplib2 code that have
been maintained:
1. Added httplib2_test.py for minimal validation.
2. Use only the python2/httplib2 subdirectory from github.

Local modifications on top of the //third_party/py/httplib2 code:
1. socks.py from the original commit is included. Comparatively,
//third_party/py/httplib2 uses //third_party/py/socks.
2. Passing the HTTPS host into the _ssl_wrap_socket method (as in cl/152201465).
