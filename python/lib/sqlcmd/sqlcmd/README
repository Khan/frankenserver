# sqlcmd: A SQL command interpreter

This is _sqlcmd_, a SQL command interpreter. See the [User's Guide][] for
complete details.

**NOTICE: I no longer maintain _sqlcmd_. It has been superceded by my 
Scala-based [sqlshell][] tool.**

To install _sqlcmd_ in the default location, type:

    python setup.py install

To install it somewhere else, such as your home directory, type:

    python setup.py install --prefix=$HOME
