class BufferedWriter(IndexWriter):
    """Convenience class that acts like a writer but buffers added documents to
    a :class:`~whoosh.ramindex.RamIndex` before dumping the buffered documents
    as a batch into the actual index.

    In scenarios where you are continuously adding single documents very
    rapidly (for example a web application where lots of users are adding
    content simultaneously), using a BufferedWriter is *much* faster than
    opening and committing a writer for each document you add.

    (This class may also be useful for batches of ``update_document`` calls. In
    a normal writer, ``update_document`` calls cannot update documents you've
    added *in that writer*. With ``BufferedWriter``, this will work.)

    If you're adding a batches of documents at a time, you can just use a
    regular writer -- you're already committing a "batch" of documents, so you
    don't need this class.

    To use this class, create it from your index and *keep it open*, sharing
    it between threads.

    >>> from whoosh.writing import BufferedWriter
    >>> writer = BufferedWriter(myindex, period=120, limit=100)

    You can control how often the ``BufferedWriter`` flushes the in-memory
    index to disk using the ``period`` and ``limit`` arguments. ``period`` is
    the maximum number of seconds between commits. ``limit`` is the maximum
    number of additions to buffer between commits.

    You can read/search the combination of the on-disk index and the buffered
    documents in memory by calling ``BufferedWriter.reader()`` or
    ``BufferedWriter.searcher()``. This allows quasi-real-time search, where
    documents are available for searching as soon as they are buffered in
    memory, before they are committed to disk.

    >>> searcher = writer.searcher()

    .. tip::
        By using a searcher from the shared writer, multiple *threads* can
        search the buffered documents. Of course, other *processes* will only
        see the documents that have been written to disk. If you want indexed
        documents to become available to other processes as soon as possible,
        you have to use a traditional writer instead of a ``BufferedWriter``.

    Calling ``commit()`` on the ``BufferedWriter`` manually commits any batched
    up changes. You can continue to make changes after calling ``commit()``,
    and you can call ``commit()`` multiple times.

    .. note::
        This object keeps an underlying writer open and stores documents in
        memory, so you must explicitly call the :meth:`~BufferedWriter.close()`
        method on this object before it goes out of scope to release the
        write lock and make sure any uncommitted changes are saved.
